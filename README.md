# redux-oidc-example

This is a small react sample app to demonstrate the usage of the Swisscom UAA service using the implicit flow of OIDC. The code is based on [redux-oidc-example](https://github.com/maxmantz/redux-oidc-example) by @maxmantz.

You will need access to the Swisscom internal instance of Cloud Foundry to use it.

## Running the example
Here's how you can run the example app in your own space.
### Clone the repo
This app uses [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) for routing.

### Create an instance of the UAA service

### Adapt the config

### Build the react app

### Push the app
